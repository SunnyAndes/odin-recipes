In the setup phase, I've learned to delete Directories which give an error. The command I need to use is :
$ sudo rm -rf [directory]

I've also got more practice within bash. I will continue to master this. I will navigate through the terminal as much as possible.

I will strive to create a good website!! 

The basic git rhythm is
1. code [file]
2. Save file within editor
3. git add [file] or git add .
4. git commit - m "Edit [file]"
5. git push
